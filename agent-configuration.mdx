title: "Agent Configuration"
description: "Customize your AI voice agent's behavior, voice, and settings"
---

## Overview

After creating your agent, you can fine-tune every aspect of its behavior. This guide covers all configuration options available on the agent settings page.

<Note>
Changes to your agent take effect immediately for new calls. Active calls continue with the previous configuration.
</Note>

---

## Identity & Purpose

The most important setting - this defines how your agent thinks and responds.

### What are Voice Instructions?

Voice Instructions tell your agent:
- **Who it is** (receptionist, sales assistant, support agent)
- **What it knows** (business info, services, policies)
- **How to respond** (tone, style, what to say/not say)
- **When to transfer** (escalation rules)

### Writing Effective Instructions

**Character Limits:**
- Minimum: 50 characters
- Maximum: 2,000 characters

**Best Practices:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ DO: Be specific and actionable">
    **Good:**
    ```
    You are the receptionist for Bright Smile Dental. We offer cleanings ($150), 
    fillings ($200-400), and teeth whitening ($500). We're open Monday-Friday 
    9AM-5PM. We accept Delta Dental, Cigna, and Aetna insurance. If someone asks 
    about emergency services, tell them to call our emergency line at 555-0199.
    ```
    
    **Why it works:** Clear facts, specific pricing, exact hours, named insurances.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ DON'T: Be vague or general">
    **Bad:**
    ```
    You are a dental office assistant. Answer questions about our services.
    ```
    
    **Why it fails:** No specifics. Agent won't know what services you offer, pricing, hours, or policies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ DO: Include common scenarios">
    **Good:**
    ```
    If someone wants to book an appointment, collect:
    - Their full name
    - Preferred date and time
    - Reason for visit (cleaning, filling, emergency)
    - Insurance provider (if applicable)
    
    Then tell them: "I've noted your request for [date/time]. Our office will 
    call you back within 2 hours to confirm."
    ```
    
    **Why it works:** Step-by-step process, clear data collection, sets expectations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ DO: Set boundaries">
    **Good:**
    ```
    Do NOT:
    - Give medical advice
    - Confirm appointments without manager approval
    - Share other patients' information
    - Promise refunds (transfer to manager instead)
    ```
    
    **Why it works:** Prevents agent from overstepping, protects your business.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Refinement (Experimental)

Use AI to improve your instructions:

1. Click **"Refine with AI"** button (sparkles icon)
2. Tell the AI what to improve:
   - "Make it more professional"
   - "Add information about our return policy"
   - "Sound friendlier for retail customers"
3. Review the before/after comparison
4. Click **"Apply"** if you like the changes

<Tip>
Refinement works best with specific feedback. Instead of "make it better," try "add our cancellation policy: 24 hours notice required."
</Tip>

## Greeting Message

The first thing callers hear when your agent answers.

### Guidelines

**Character Limits:**
- Minimum: 20 characters
- Maximum: 200 characters

**Best Practices:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Professional
"Thank you for calling Bright Smile Dental. This is Emma, your AI assistant. How can I help you today?"
```

```text Friendly
"Hey there! You've reached Pete's Pizza. I'm your virtual order assistant. What can I get started for you?"
```

```text Concise
"Smith & Associates. How may I direct your call?"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Keep it under 15 seconds when spoken. Callers hang up if the greeting is too long.
</Warning>

### What to Include

✅ **Always include:**
- Business name
- Agent identification (optional: "AI assistant" for transparency)
- Clear call-to-action

❌ **Avoid:**
- Menu options ("Press 1 for...") - agent handles this conversationally
- Legal disclaimers - put these in instructions instead
- Multiple questions - one question is enough

---

## Voice Selection

Choose from 100+ professional AI voices.

### Finding the Right Voice

1. **Use Filters:**
   - **Language:** 50+ languages available
   - **Gender:** Male, Female, or All
   - **Search:** Type keywords like "professional," "friendly," "young"

2. **Preview Voices:**
   - Click the **play button** (▶) next to any voice
   - Listen to sample phrases in context
   - Test 3-5 before deciding

3. **Match Your Brand:**
   - **Law firm:** Calm, authoritative voice
   - **Kids store:** Energetic, friendly voice
   - **Medical office:** Warm, trustworthy voice
   - **Tech support:** Clear, patient voice

<Tip>
You can change voices anytime. Test new voices with the "Test Agent" feature before going live.
</Tip>

### Voice Quality

All voices are:
- **HD quality** (24kHz sample rate)
- **Natural pronunciation** (handles complex words)
- **Consistent** (same voice across all calls)
- **Low latency** (<300ms response time)

---

## Phone Number Connection

Assign a phone number so customers can reach your agent.

### Assigning a Number

1. Go to **Phone Numbers** in sidebar
2. Find an available number
3. Click **"Assign to Agent"**
4. Select this agent
5. Click **"Assign"**

<Note>
One phone number can only be assigned to one agent at a time. To reassign, unassign from the current agent first.
</Note>

### Testing Your Number

After assignment:
1. Click **"Test"** button in agent header
2. Call the number from your phone
3. Verify:
   - Greeting plays correctly
   - Agent responds to questions
   - Voice quality is clear

---

## Knowledge Base

Upload documents so your agent can answer detailed questions.

### What You Can Upload

- **PDFs:** Product manuals, price lists, policies
- **Text files:** FAQs, knowledge base articles
- **Word docs:** Standard operating procedures
- **Max file size:** 10 MB per file
- **Max total:** 50 MB per agent

### How It Works

1. **Upload:** Click **"Add Knowledge"** → Choose files
2. **Processing:** Files are chunked and indexed (takes 30-60 seconds)
3. **Querying:** When a caller asks a question, agent searches your knowledge base
4. **Response:** Agent answers using exact information from your documents

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Upload your FAQ document. The agent will give word-for-word answers from your approved content.
</Tip>

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Upload well-structured documents (clear headings, sections)
- Keep information up-to-date
- Use plain language (agent quotes directly from docs)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Upload confidential customer data
- Include outdated pricing
- Upload scanned images (use OCR text instead)

## Advanced Settings

Fine-tune your agent's behavior.

### Creativity (Temperature)

Controls how creative vs. factual your agent's responses are.

**Scale:** 0.0 (Factual) to 1.0 (Creative)

| Level | Temperature | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | 0.0 - 0.3 | Medical, legal, technical support |
| **Focused** | 0.3 - 0.5 | Customer service, scheduling |
| **Balanced** | 0.5 - 0.7 | Sales, general inquiries (default) |
| **Creative** | 0.7 - 0.9 | Marketing, storytelling |
| **Very Creative** | 0.9 - 1.0 | Entertainment, creative fields |

<Tip>
Start with **0.6** (Balanced) and adjust based on call quality. Lower if agent is too chatty, higher if responses feel robotic.
</Tip>

### Max Call Duration

Automatically end calls after a set time.

**Range:** 30 seconds - 30 minutes (1800 seconds)

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Quick info:** 2-3 minutes (120-180s)
- **Appointments:** 5-7 minutes (300-420s)
- **Support calls:** 10-15 minutes (600-900s)
- **Sales:** 15-20 minutes (900-1200s)

<Warning>
Calls end gracefully with: "I need to end this call now. Please call back if you need more help. Goodbye!"
</Warning>

---

## Testing Your Configuration

After making changes:

1. **Click "Test"** in agent header
2. **Make a test call:**
   - In-browser: Click "Call Now"
   - From phone: Dial your agent's number
3. **Check:**
   - Does greeting sound right?
   - Does agent know your business info?
   - Are responses helpful and accurate?
   - Is voice quality clear?

### Iterating

Configuration is iterative:

1. **Test** → Find issues
2. **Adjust** instructions, creativity, or voice
3. **Test again** → Verify improvements
4. **Repeat** until satisfied

<Tip>
Make one change at a time so you know what improves (or worsens) performance.
</Tip>
