## Overview

Phone numbers are how customers reach your AI agents. Optima Voice makes it easy to purchase new numbers or bring your existing ones.

**Two options:**
1. **Purchase from Telnyx** (recommended) - Instant provisioning, $1-5/month
2. **Manual Entry** - Use your existing business number

---

## Purchasing a Number (Recommended)

### Step 1: Open Add Number Drawer

1. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Add Number"** button
3. Select the **"Purchase from Telnyx"** tab

### Step 2: Search for Numbers

**Choose your country:**
- Select from 75+ supported countries
- Popular: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia
- Each country has different pricing ($1-5/month typically)

**Optional: Filter by area code**
- Leave blank to see all available numbers
- Enter specific area code for local presence
  - Example: "212" for New York City
  - Example: "415" for San Francisco
  - Example: "020" for London

**Click "Search"**

### Step 3: Browse Results

You'll see up to 20 available numbers:

```
+1 (555) 123-4567  |  Local  |  $2.00/month  |  [Purchase]
+1 (555) 234-5678  |  Local  |  $2.00/month  |  [Purchase]
+1 (555) 345-6789  |  Toll-Free | $5.00/month | [Purchase]
```

**Number types:**
- **Local:** Standard area code numbers
- **Toll-Free:** 800, 888, 877, etc. (higher cost, professional appearance)

## Manual Entry (Existing Numbers)

Already have a business number? Forward it to Optima Voice.

### Step 1: Enter Number Details

1. Click **"Add Number"** button
2. Select **"Manual Entry"** tab
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** Identifier (e.g., "Main Reception Line")
   - **Phone Number:** Your existing number (format: +1234567890)
   - **Agent:** Which agent handles this number

### Step 2: Configure Outbound (Optional)

If your agent needs to make outbound calls:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Outbound Configuration (Advanced)">
    Enable outbound calling to let your agent initiate calls:
    
    **Required fields:**
    - **Outbound Address:** Your SIP provider's address
    - **Auth Username:** SIP account username
    - **Auth Password:** SIP account password
    
    **Optional settings:**
    - **Transport:** AUTO (recommended), UDP, TCP, TLS
    - **Media Encryption:** DISABLE (default), SRTP
    - **Krisp Noise Cancellation:** On/Off
    
    <Note>
    Most users don't need outbound. This is for advanced call center setups.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Set Up Call Forwarding

After adding your number to Optima Voice:

1. **We'll provide SIP credentials** (displayed after setup)
2. **Configure your carrier** to forward calls to our SIP address
3. **Test the connection** by calling your number

<Warning>
Manual setup requires technical knowledge of SIP/VoIP. Most users prefer purchasing numbers directly through Optima Voice for instant setup.
</Warning>

## Managing Phone Numbers

### Assigning to Agents

Each number can be assigned to one agent at a time.

**To assign:**
1. Find the number in your Phone Numbers list
2. Click **"Assign to Agent"**
3. Select agent from dropdown
4. Click **"Assign"**

**To reassign:**
1. Click **"Reassign"** on the number
2. Select different agent
3. Click **"Confirm"**
4. Previous agent stops receiving calls immediately
5. New agent starts receiving calls

<Note>
Reassigning is instant. Active calls continue with the old agent, but new calls route to the newly assigned agent.
</Note>

### Unassigning Numbers

Remove an agent from a number without deleting it:

1. Click on the phone number row
2. Click **"Unassign"**
3. Confirm

**Result:** Number stays in your account but doesn't route to any agent. Callers hear a generic message.

<Warning>
Unassigned numbers still incur monthly charges. Delete them if you don't plan to use them.
</Warning>

### Deleting Numbers

**Purchased numbers:**
1. Click **"Delete"** on the number row
2. Confirm deletion
3. Number is released back to Telnyx
4. Monthly charges stop at end of billing cycle

**Manually entered numbers:**
1. Click **"Delete"**
2. Confirm
3. Number is removed from Optima Voice
4. Your original carrier still has the number (set up forwarding elsewhere)

<Warning>
**Deletion is permanent.** If you delete a purchased number, you cannot guarantee getting the same number back. Someone else might claim it.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Number Selection

✅ **DO:**
- **Choose memorable numbers** when possible (repeating digits, patterns)
- **Match area codes** to your business location for local credibility
- **Use toll-free** for national brands or premium services
- **Purchase multiple** if you have multiple agents (reception, sales, support)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use vanity numbers with letters (hard to remember: 1-800-FLOWERS vs 1-800-356-9377)
- Buy numbers in random cities (looks unprofessional if customer is in New York and sees Los Angeles number)
- Reuse personal mobile numbers (keep business and personal separate)

### Assignment Strategy

**Single Agent:**
- Purchase 1 number
- Assign to your only agent
- Simple setup, one point of contact

**Multiple Agents:**
- Purchase 1 number per department:
  - +1 (555) 100-0001 → Sales Agent
  - +1 (555) 100-0002 → Support Agent
  - +1 (555) 100-0003 → Billing Agent
- Advertise different numbers for different purposes

**High Volume:**
- Purchase multiple numbers for the same agent
- Distribute to different marketing channels
- Track which channel drives calls (see call logs)
