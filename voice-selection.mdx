- Use case: "customer service," "sales," "medical"

**Filter by language:**
- Toggle **"Filter by [LANGUAGE]"** checkbox
- When enabled: Only compatible voices shown
- When disabled: All voices visible (check language compatibility yourself)

### Step 3: Preview Voices

**How to preview:**
1. Click the **play button** (▶) on any voice card
2. Listen to a sample phrase in context
3. Preview plays for 3-5 seconds
4. Only one voice plays at a time (clicking another stops current preview)

**What to listen for:**

- **Tone:** Does it match your brand personality?
- **Pacing:** Too fast, too slow, or just right?

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Preview 3-5 voices before deciding. Your first choice isn't always the best one.
