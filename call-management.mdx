## Best Practices

### Regular Review

✅ **DO:**
- Review 5-10 calls per week
- Listen to failed calls immediately
- Check new agent's first 20 calls closely
- Sample calls from peak hours

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ignore call logs for weeks
- Only listen when there's a complaint
- Assume all calls are perfect

### Using Insights

**Pattern spotted → Action taken:**
- Many callers ask same question → Add to FAQ/knowledge base
- Agent gives wrong info → Update voice instructions
- Calls drop at same point → Check max duration settings
- Customer satisfaction low → Refine greeting or tone

- Create "Do This" vs "Not This" compilations
