2. Choose from three creation methods:

### Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended)

AI-powered agent creation - fastest way to get started:

1. **Business Name**: Your company name
2. **Business Description**: Tell us what you do (2-3 sentences)
   - Example: "We're a dental office offering cleanings, fillings, and cosmetic dentistry. We're open Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM."
3. **Agent Goal**: What should this agent handle?
   - Example: "Answer patient questions, book appointments, provide pricing"
4. Click **"Generate Agent"**

Our AI automatically creates:
- Professional greeting message
- Conversation instructions tailored to your business
- Appropriate tone and personality

<Tip>
The more specific your business description, the better your agent performs. Include hours, services, and key policies.
</Tip>

<Tip>
