title: "Knowledge Base"
description: "Upload documents and content for your agent to reference"
---

## Overview

The Knowledge Base lets your agents answer detailed questions by referencing your uploaded content. Upload PDFs, documents, website links, or text snippets - your agent will search and quote directly from them.

**What you can upload:**
- PDF documents (manuals, guides, policies)
- Text files (.txt, .md)
- Website URLs (automatically crawled)
- Text snippets (FAQ answers, procedures)

**Max storage:** 50 MB per organization

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload:** Add documents or content to your knowledge base
2. **Processing:** Content is indexed for search (30-60 seconds)
3. **Query:** During calls, agents search your knowledge when answering questions
4. **Response:** Agents quote directly from your documents

<Tip>
Agents cite sources when answering from knowledge base: "According to your FAQ document..."
</Tip>

## Adding Knowledge

### Upload Files

**Supported formats:**
- PDF (.pdf)
- Text (.txt, .md)
- Word (.doc, .docx)
- Max file size: 10 MB per file

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Upload Files"** button
2. Select one or more files
3. Files upload and process automatically
4. Green checkmark appears when ready

<Note>
Processing takes 30-60 seconds. Your agent can't access the content until processing completes.
</Note>

### Add Website URL

Import content from any public website:

1. Click **"Add URL"** button
2. Enter website address (e.g., https://example.com/faq)
3. Click **"Import"**
4. Content is crawled and indexed

**What gets imported:**
- Main text content
- Headings and structure
- Links within the page (optional)

**Not imported:**
- Images
- Videos
- Forms
- Private/login-required pages

<Warning>
Only import content you have permission to use. Respect copyright and terms of service.
</Warning>

### Create Text Snippet

For quick FAQ-style answers:

1. Click **"Text Snippet"** button
2. Enter **Title** (question or topic)
3. Enter **Content** (answer or information)
4. Click **"Save"**

**Example:**
```
Title: Return Policy
Content: We accept returns within 30 days of purchase with original receipt. Items must be in new, unused condition. Shipping fees are non-refundable. Contact support@example.com to initiate a return.
```

## Organizing Knowledge

### Folders

Keep knowledge organized with folders:

**Create folder:**
1. Click **"New Folder"** button
2. Name your folder (e.g., "Product Manuals," "Policies," "FAQs")
3. Click **"Create"**

**Move items into folders:**
1. Drag and drop items onto folder
2. Or use item menu → "Move to folder"

**Navigate:**
- Click folder to view contents
- Click back arrow to return to root

<Tip>
Use folders to separate different knowledge types: Product Info, Company Policies, FAQs, Procedures
</Tip>

### Reordering

Drag and drop items to reorder priority:

- **Items at top** = searched first
- **Items at bottom** = searched last

Use this to prioritize frequently accessed information.

---

## Linking Knowledge to Agents

Knowledge is **organization-level** - all agents can access it.

To limit which agents use specific knowledge:

1. Go to agent settings
2. Find **Knowledge Base** card
3. Select which folders/items this agent can access
4. Unselected knowledge won't appear in searches for that agent

<Note>
This feature allows department-specific knowledge. Sales agent sees product docs, support agent sees troubleshooting guides.
</Note>

---

## Editing & Managing

### Edit Item

1. Click item menu (⋮ three dots)
2. Select **"Edit"**
3. Update title or content
4. Click **"Save"**

**Changes take effect immediately** - no reprocessing needed.

### Delete Item

1. Click item menu (⋮)
2. Select **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent. Agents will no longer have access to this information.
</Warning>

### View Details

Click any item to view:
- **Title** and content preview
- **File size** and type
- **Upload date**
- **Last modified**
- **Usage stats** (how often agents reference it)

## Best Practices

### Content Preparation

✅ **DO:**
- **Use clear headings** (helps agents find sections)
- **Write in plain language** (agents quote verbatim)
- **Keep information current** (update docs regularly)
- **Structure content logically** (Q&A format works well)
- **Include common questions** customers ask

❌ **DON'T:**
- Upload scanned images (use OCR to convert to text first)
- Use complex formatting (tables might not parse correctly)
- Include confidential data (passwords, SSNs, internal memos)
- Upload outdated pricing or policies

### File Organization

**Good structure:**
```
📁 Product Information
  - Product Catalog.pdf
  - Pricing Sheet.pdf
  - Technical Specs.pdf

📁 Company Policies
  - Return Policy.txt
  - Shipping Policy.txt
  - Privacy Policy.pdf

📁 FAQs
  - Common Questions.txt
  - Troubleshooting Guide.pdf
```

### Updating Content

When information changes:
1. **Edit existing items** (don't duplicate)
2. **Delete outdated versions**
3. **Test with agent** to verify new answers

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent isn't using my knowledge base">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Knowledge still processing (wait 60 seconds)
    - Agent instructions don't mention using knowledge
    - Question doesn't match content
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check processing status (should show green checkmark)
    - Add to instructions: "Use the knowledge base to answer detailed questions"
    - Make content more discoverable (use clear headings, Q&A format)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent gives wrong information from knowledge base">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Outdated content in knowledge base
    - Content is ambiguous or unclear
    - Multiple conflicting sources
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Review and update content

## Search & Query

### How Agents Search

When a customer asks a question:
1. Agent identifies key terms
2. Searches knowledge base for relevant content
3. Reads matching sections
4. Formulates answer using exact quotes

**Example:**
- **Customer:** "What's your return policy?"
- **Agent searches:** "return policy"
- **Finds:** Return Policy.pdf, page 2
- **Agent responds:** "According to our return policy, we accept returns within 30 days of purchase with the original receipt..."

### Improving Search Results

Make content more discoverable:
- **Use customer language** (not internal jargon)
- **Include synonyms** ("refund" and "return")
- **Answer questions directly** (start with "Yes" or "No")
- **Repeat key terms** throughout content

---

## Storage Limits

**Per organization:** 50 MB total

**Typical usage:**
- Text file (.txt): ~10-50 KB
- PDF manual: 1-5 MB
- Website page: ~100-500 KB

**50 MB holds approximately:**
- 500 text snippets
- 10-25 PDF manuals
- 50-100 website pages
- Or mix of all types

**When you hit the limit:**
1. Delete unused knowledge
2. Compress large PDFs
3. Upgrade plan for more storage (coming soon)

## Security & Privacy

### What We Store

- Your uploaded files (encrypted at rest)
- Processed text for search indexing
- Upload metadata (date, size, title)

### What We Don't Store

- Temporary/session data
- Intermediate processing files
- User access logs beyond 90 days

### Access Control

- **Organization-level:** All team members see all knowledge
- **Agent-level:** Restrict which agents use specific knowledge

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple agents use the same knowledge?">
    Yes. Knowledge is shared across all agents in your organization. Each agent can be configured to use specific folders or all knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often should I update my knowledge base?">
    Update whenever information changes (pricing, policies, products). Review quarterly to remove outdated content. Agents quote verbatim, so accuracy is critical.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I import from Google Docs or Notion?">
    Not directly. Export to PDF or copy text into a snippet. We're adding direct integrations soon.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit on number of items?">
    No item count limit - only 50 MB storage limit. You can have 1,000 small text files or 10 large PDFs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete knowledge an agent is using?">
    Agent immediately loses access. Future calls won't reference that content. Active calls continue with cached data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
