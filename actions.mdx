## Overview

Actions let your agents do more than talk - they can book appointments, send emails, create tickets, update databases, and trigger workflows automatically during calls.

**Available integrations:**
- Google Calendar (appointments)
- Gmail (send confirmations)
- Slack (team notifications)
- HubSpot (CRM updates)
- Salesforce (lead creation)
- 100+ more apps

---

## How Actions Work

1. **Connect:** Authorize Optima Voice to access your account (OAuth)
2. **Configure:** Set up which actions your agent can perform
3. **Trigger:** Agent automatically performs actions during calls
4. **Verify:** Check action results in call logs

**Example flow:**
1. Customer calls and requests appointment
2. Agent collects date/time preference
3. Agent checks Google Calendar for availability
4. Agent books appointment automatically
5. Agent confirms booking to customer
6. Agent sends confirmation email via Gmail

---

## Browsing Available Actions

### Access Actions Page

1. Go to **Actions** in sidebar
2. You'll see two tabs:
   - **Available Apps:** Browse and connect new integrations
   - **Connected:** View and manage active connections

### Search & Filter

**Search bar:**
- Type app name (e.g., "Gmail," "Slack," "HubSpot")
- Search by capability (e.g., "email," "calendar," "CRM")

**Filter by category:**
- All
- Communication (email, chat, SMS)
- Productivity (calendars, notes, tasks)
- CRM & Sales
- Marketing
- Developer Tools
- And more

<Tip>
Use search to find exactly what you need. Example: Search "email" to find Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid, etc.
</Tip>

## Connecting an Integration

### Step 1: Find the App

1. Browse or search for the app you want
2. Click the app card to view details:
   - Description of what it does
   - List of available actions
   - Auth requirements

### Step 2: Connect Your Account

1. Click **"Connect"** button
2. OAuth authorization popup opens
3. Sign in to your account (if not already)
4. Review permissions requested
5. Click **"Allow"** or **"Authorize"**

<Note>
You're redirected to the app's official login page. Optima Voice never sees your password - all authentication uses secure OAuth standards.
</Note>

### Step 3: Confirmation

After authorization:
- Popup closes automatically
- Success message appears
- App moves to "Connected" tab
- Agent can now use this integration

---

## Managing Connected Actions

### View Connected Apps

1. Go to Actions page
2. Click **"Connected"** tab
3. See all active integrations:
   - App name and icon
   - Connection status
   - Connected account (email)
   - Actions available

### Disconnect an Integration

To revoke access:

1. Find the app in "Connected" tab
2. Click **"Disconnect"** button
3. Confirm disconnection

<Warning>
Disconnecting immediately stops your agents from using this integration. Active calls may fail if they're mid-action.
</Warning>

### Multiple Accounts

Some apps allow multiple account connections:

**Example:** Connect both:
- work@company.com (for business appointments)
- support@company.com (for support tickets)

Agents will prompt which account to use, or you can configure default in agent settings.

---

## Configuring Agent Actions

After connecting an app, assign actions to specific agents:

### Step 1: Go to Agent Settings

1. Navigate to your agent's configuration page
2. Find **"Actions & Integrations"** card

### Step 2: Select Actions

1. Click **"Add Action"**
2. Choose connected app
3. Select specific actions to enable:
   - ✅ Book appointment
   - ✅ Send confirmation email
   - ❌ Delete events (leave disabled for safety)
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Configure Triggers

Tell your agent when to use each action:

**In Voice Instructions, add:**
```
When a customer wants to book an appointment:
1. Check their preferred date and time
2. Search Google Calendar for availability
3. If slot is available, book the appointment
4. Confirm booking details to customer
5. Send confirmation email to their address

When a customer needs help:
1. Create a support ticket in HubSpot
2. Collect: name, email, issue description
3. Notify #support channel in Slack
```

<Tip>
Be explicit about when to use actions. Agents won't guess - they follow your instructions exactly.
</Tip>

## Action Security & Permissions

### What Permissions Are Needed?

Each integration requests specific permissions:

**Google Calendar:**
- View calendar events
- Create new events
- Edit events you created

**Gmail:**
- Send emails on your behalf
- View sent emails

**Slack:**
- Post messages to channels
- Send direct messages

<Note>
Optima Voice only requests minimal permissions needed for functionality. We never request permissions to delete data or access unrelated information.
</Note>

### Revoking Access

You can revoke access anytime:

1. **In Optima Voice:** Disconnect the integration
2. **In the app:** Go to app's "Connected Apps" settings and revoke Optima Voice access

Both methods immediately stop data access.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails during OAuth">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Popup blocked by browser
    - Account doesn't have admin permissions
    - App's OAuth service is down
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Allow popups for app.optima-voice.com
    - Use admin account or request admin to connect
    - Try again in a few minutes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent isn't performing actions">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Action not enabled for this agent
    - Missing instructions on when to use action
    - Permission error
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check agent Actions card - is action enabled?
    - Add explicit instructions for when to trigger action
    - Reconnect the integration to refresh permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Action fails during call">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Connected account lacks permissions (read-only)
    - Rate limit hit (too many actions too fast)
    - Invalid data provided
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use account with write permissions
    - Add delays between actions in instructions
    - Validate data before triggering action
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which account is being used?">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Multiple accounts connected for same app
    - Agent doesn't specify account
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check "Connected" tab for account email
    - Disconnect extra accounts if not needed
    - Specify in instructions: "Use work@company.com calendar"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Start Small

✅ **DO:**
- Connect one integration at a time
- Test with simple actions first (e.g., send email)
- Gradually add more complex workflows

❌ **DON'T:**
- Connect 10 apps at once without testing
- Enable all actions immediately
- Skip testing in development

### Be Explicit in Instructions

**Good:**
```
When customer requests appointment:
1. Ask for preferred date and time
2. Check Google Calendar for availability
3. If available: create event, confirm to customer
4. If unavailable: offer next available slot
5. Send confirmation email with event details
```

**Bad:**
```
Handle appointment requests.
```

### Test Actions Separately

Before live deployment:
1. Call your agent
2. Trigger each action manually
3. Verify results in connected app
4. Check for errors in call logs

### Monitor Action Usage

Regularly check:
- **Call logs:** Are actions completing successfully?
- **Connected app:** Are records correct?
- **Error rates:** High failure rates? Investigate.

---

## Limitations

### Rate Limits

Each integrated app has rate limits:
- **Google Calendar:** ~1,000 requests/day
- **Gmail:** ~500 emails/day
- **Slack:** ~1 message/second

**High-volume use cases:** Contact support for enterprise limits.

### Action Complexity

Agents can handle:
- ✅ Single-step actions (send email, create event)
- ✅ 2-3 step workflows (check → create → confirm)
- ❌ Complex multi-app workflows (requires custom development)

### Data Validation

Agents validate data before actions:
- Email addresses must be valid
- Dates must be future (not past)
- Required fields must be filled

**Invalid data = action fails gracefully** with error message to customer.

## Coming Soon

We're adding:
- Custom webhooks (trigger any HTTP endpoint)
- Zapier integration (access 5,000+ apps)
- Action templates (pre-built workflows)
